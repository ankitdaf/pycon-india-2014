Facebook Likes on Tiny Screens
========================================

The Arduino sketch in this folder runs a Python Script that resides on an SD card plugged into the Arduino Yun. 
This code gets the data given to it from the console, and prints it out to the TFT LCD.

The Python script authenticates you with the Facebook app that you need to create, with Manage Pages privileges, and then fetches all the pages and the number of likes.

This example needs an Arduino Yun and a SD card / USB drive
